# @paragraph-com/mcp

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for [Paragraph](https://paragraph.com) — expose your publication to AI agents in Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, and any MCP-compatible client.

## Remote server (recommended)

Use the hosted server at `mcp.paragraph.com` — no installation or API key management required. You'll authenticate through your Paragraph account in the browser.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add paragraph --transport http https://mcp.paragraph.com/mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paragraph": {
      "url": "https://mcp.paragraph.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paragraph": {
      "url": "https://mcp.paragraph.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code

Add to `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "paragraph": {
      "url": "https://mcp.paragraph.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Local server

If you prefer to run the server locally, you can use npx. Requires Node.js 18+.

```bash
npx @paragraph-com/mcp
```

### Authentication (local only)

The remote server handles auth automatically. For local usage, set your API key via environment variable:

```bash
PARAGRAPH_API_KEY=your-key npx @paragraph-com/mcp
```

Or log in with the [Paragraph CLI](https://github.com/paragraph-xyz/paragraph-cli) — the MCP server shares the same config:

```bash
npx @paragraph-com/cli login
npx @paragraph-com/mcp
```

Only expose the tools your agent needs:

```

Available toolsets: `posts`, `publications`, `subscribers`, `users`, `coins`, `search`, `feed`, `me`, `analytics`

## Examples

### Search and summarize posts on a topic

**Prompt:** "Search for posts about onchain governance and give me a summary of the top results"

The MCP server calls `search-posts` with the query. Claude receives the matching posts and synthesizes a summary of the key themes, authors, and publications.

### Draft and publish a blog post

**Prompt:** "Write a post titled 'Weekly Update #12' about our new token-gating feature, then publish it"

The server calls `create-post` with the title and generated markdown content, creating it as a draft. After you confirm, it calls `update-post` to set the status to `published`, making it live on your publication.

### Get subscriber analytics

**Prompt:** "How many subscribers does my publication have? Show me the most recent ones."

The server calls `get-me` to identify your publication, then `get-subscriber-count` for the total, and `list-subscribers` to return the latest subscribers with their details.

### Answer questions about newsletter performance

**Prompt:** "What's my average open rate over the last 30 days, and which posts performed best?"

The server calls `analytics-query` with a scoped SQL query against `post_analytics_summary`, returning open rates, CTR, and views for each post. Claude summarizes the trend and highlights the top performers.

### Explore the platform feed

**Prompt:** "What's trending on Paragraph right now?"

The server calls `get-feed` to retrieve the curated platform feed and Claude summarizes the top posts, their authors, and topics.

### Manage post lifecycle

**Prompt:** "Show me my drafts and send a test email for the most recent one"

The server calls `list-posts` with `status: draft` to retrieve your drafts, then `send-test-email` with the latest draft's ID so you can preview the newsletter in your inbox before sending it to subscribers.
